        "output": "Based on the given information, I was unable to find any information about a recall specifically for the 1997 Toyota Camry regarding disc brake failures. However, I did find a recall related to the brake system. \n\nRecall Number: 97V131000\n\nSummary: A condition can occur in vehicles used in extremely cold climates where accumulated moisture in the brake vacuum hose can temporarily freeze, leading to a loss of vacuum assist to the brakes, which can increase stopping distances and potentially cause a vehicle crash. Dealers will install a new design brake vacuum hose to resolve the issue."
